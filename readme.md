## About this project
I started developing this project to challange myself into learning front-end development, as I am mostly a back-end developer. It was a long way, over 4 months for the first deploy, but it helped me to learn many skills I was looking for. Now I will keep mantaining it, refactoring with better practices and implementing new feartures. 

Deployed on Vecel. **[Check it out!](https://www.lucashardman.com.br)**
