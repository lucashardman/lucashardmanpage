## About this project
I started developing this project to challenge myself to learn front-end development, as I am primarily a back-end developer. It was a long journey, taking over 4 months to deploy, but it provided me with an opportunity to acquire many skills I was seeking. Now, I will continue maintaining it, refactoring with better practices, and implementing new features.

Deployed on Vercel. **[Check it out!](https://www.lucashardman.com.br)**
